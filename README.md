# mazes-clj

An implementation of the algorithms and data structures from [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers)
in pure Clojure. There are no objects/references to be found here!

This is a work in progress as I read the book, so some of the stuff may fundamentally change if I discover limitations/inefficiencies in my current approach.
